# lego-train-controller

A Python-based controller for LEGO Technic Hubs using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communication. This project allows you to control LEGO switches and trains through both a REST API and command-line interface. It supports advanced features like self-driving trains with color pattern recognition and reliable switch control.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `bleak` library for Bluetooth Low Energy communication
- `msgpack` for data serialization
- Linux system with Bluetooth support (tested on Raspberry Pi)
- Root/sudo privileges for Bluetooth operations
- FastAPI and uvicorn for the web service
- Python virtual environment (recommended)
- LEGO Technic Hubs (City Hub for trains, Technic Hub for switches)
- LEGO Color Distance Sensor (for self-driving train functionality)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/lego-train-controller.git
   cd lego-train-controller
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running the Web Service

### Direct Command Line

You can run the web service directly using uvicorn:

```bash
sudo PYTHONPATH=/path/to/lego-train-controller uvicorn webservice.train_service:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

### As a System Service

To run as a system service (recommended for production), see **[SYSTEMD_SERVICE_SETUP.md](SYSTEMD_SERVICE_SETUP.md)** for a comprehensive guide.

Quick setup:

1. Create the service file:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/lego-controller.service
   ```

2. Add the configuration (update paths to match your installation):
   ```ini
   [Unit]
   Description=LEGO Train and Switch Controller Service
   After=network.target bluetooth.target
   Requires=bluetooth.service

   [Service]
   Type=simple
   User=pi
   Group=bluetooth
   WorkingDirectory=/home/pi/lego-train-controller
   Environment="PYTHONPATH=/home/pi/lego-train-controller"
   ExecStart=/home/pi/lego-train-controller/.venv/bin/uvicorn webservice.train_service:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
   Restart=always
   RestartSec=10

   [Install]
   WantedBy=multi-user.target
   ```

3. Enable and start:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   sudo systemctl enable lego-controller
   sudo systemctl start lego-controller
   sudo systemctl status lego-controller   # Check service status
   ```

### Recent Structure Changes

The project has recently undergone a structural reorganization to improve code organization and maintainability:

1. **Controller Logic Separation**:
   - Controller logic has been moved from `servers/` to a dedicated `controllers/` directory
   - This separates the business logic from the server infrastructure

2. **Shared Utilities**:
   - Constants and shared utilities have been moved to a dedicated `utils/` directory
   - This improves reusability and makes dependencies clearer

3. **Import Structure**:
   - Changed from relative imports to absolute imports for better reliability
   - This prevents issues with imports when running from different contexts

These changes make the codebase more modular and easier to maintain, while preserving all functionality.

### Recommended Structure Improvements
For future development, consider these additional structural improvements:

1. **Configuration Management**:
   - Add a dedicated `config/` directory for configuration files
   - Move hardcoded constants to configuration files

2. **Testing**:
   - Add a `tests/` directory with unit and integration tests
   - Include test fixtures for simulating hub connections

3. **Documentation**:
   - Create a `docs/` directory with detailed documentation
   - Add inline code documentation using docstrings

4. **Examples**:
   - Add an `examples/` directory with sample scripts
   - Include example configurations for different setups

5. **Client-Server Separation**:
   - Consider separating client code into a dedicated package
   - This would allow for easier distribution of client libraries

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the service logs:
   ```bash
   sudo journalctl -u lego-controller -f
   ```

2. View application logs:
   ```bash
   sudo tail -f /var/log/lego-controller.log
   sudo tail -f /var/log/lego-controller.error.log
   ```

3. Reset Bluetooth connections:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/reset
   ```

4. Verify Bluetooth status:
   ```bash
   sudo hciconfig
   ```

## Self-Driving Train Features

The self-driving train functionality uses a LEGO Color Distance Sensor to detect colors and patterns on the track. Key features include:

- Color pattern recognition (RED, YELLOW, GREEN, BLUE, GRAY, WHITE)
- Automatic stopping at programmed color patterns
- Forward and backward movement until pattern detection
- Noise filtering for reliable color detection
- Real-time status reporting during autonomous operation

To use self-driving mode:
1. Set up a track with color markers (using LEGO bricks or colored paper)
2. Enable self-driving mode via the API
3. The train will automatically respond to color patterns based on programmed behavior

## Error Handling and Reliability

The system includes comprehensive error handling for:
- Bluetooth connection issues with automatic recovery
- Command transmission failures with intelligent retry mechanisms
- Invalid API requests with detailed error responses
- Status parsing errors with fallback mechanisms
- Service recovery and auto-restart
- Command verification with position feedback
- Reliability statistics for monitoring system performance

Each operation includes multiple fallback mechanisms to ensure reliable communication with the LEGO hubs, with special attention to the challenges of Bluetooth communication in potentially noisy environments.
